PVPHistoryClassic+
------------------

**PVPHistoryClassic+ is a maintained addon for World of Warcraft Classic (Season of Discovery). It will automatically detect and save battleground
data and present it in a easy way. It allows for sorting after common criteria like kills, deaths, or duration and plans to offer even more
information like the player in your party, winrate across different battlegrounds and more.
It will be maintained and updated with new features for the upcoming phases with simplicity and efficiency in mind.**
